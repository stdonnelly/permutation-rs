Permutations in Rust

I just made this to mess around with the Rust language. This was originally intended to be a port of [permutation-py](https://github.com/stdonnelly/permutation-py). There turned out to be an issue with the logic of that program that caused it to not display all permutations if n > r. This one *should* work, though.
